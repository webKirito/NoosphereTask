# NoosphereTask
I have created a game which I get as my first task.
This game has one class which describes the main game logic.
I have used Jquery for easier DOM manipulating. So some main components were Jquery-objects.
I have used ES2017 and some features like OOP-mode, string interpolation, arrow functions , destructing assigment and so on.
I have written styles (CSS) by myself. I had a desire to make modal by myself. But I had to use
Bootstrap and unfortunely I have made modal with its help.
Also I have made minified files for js, css , html.
By the way , to make CSS I`ve used preprocessing SASS - I find it better for development.

Rules:
Push StartBtn and click Cubes to get Score. After time has gone there is a modal , where you can push your 
name. After page reloads - you can find your name in result table. As DB - cookie. It is very easy to use.

Differences in the task:
I have made ResultTable button to hide and show table. Also I have changed some styles.
As game process you (developer) can choose options such as game time and game speed.
